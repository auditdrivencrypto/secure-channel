# secure-channel

This is a project to design a secure-channel (encrypted duplex connection)

# design process

This protocol will be developed in an audit-first style.
The first phase was to study and summarize [prior art](./prior-art.md),
then to summarize the [abstract properties](./properties.md) of secure channels.

And then create draft proposals ([draft 1](./draft.md), [draft 2](./draft2.md)).

I have not started to write code yet.

# discussion process

All discussion should yield updates to the design documents.
Therefore, rather than opening discussions as issues, they should be submitted as PRs which include

 1. An opening summary of the topic under discussion
 2. An opinionated patch to the documents

Discussion will then take place in the PR, and the patch will be modified to reflect the final decisions.

If the author does not have a strong opinion on what the final decision should be, the patch should at least reflect the potential updates to the documents.
