# secure-channel

This is a project to design a secure-channel (encrypted duplex connection)

# design process

This protocol will be developed in an audit-first style.
The first phase was to study and summarize [prior art](./prior-art.md),
then to summarize their properties and list them [explicitly](./properties.md)

And then create draft proposals ([draft 1](./draft.md), [draft 2](./draft2.md)).

I have not started to write code yet.
